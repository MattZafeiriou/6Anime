## Lessons Learned

Since I started creating this app I learned a lot about how to use the React Environment and some of its packages. I also learned how to use bootstrap (react).
In the prototype I tried linking the videos to torrent files; this way I had to make a .torrent file encryptor and decryptor (not released on github yet.)
I faced many problems in the meantime and finally made it through all of them. Some of them were which video player to use. How do I gain the video without anything saved on my local server. And many more.
